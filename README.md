## 1. Research background and motivation
Airbnb, short for “Air Bed and Breakfast”, is a well-known service that enables property owners to rent out their homes, apartments or individual rooms to travelers looking for alternatives to conventional hotels.  Since its establishment in 2008, Airbnb now operates in more than 220 countries with over 4 million listings (Airbnb, n.d.). The platform has created a new form of accommodation that is frequently less costly and more adaptable than traditional options. Nonetheless, Airbnb prices can vary based on different factors such as the area, time of year, and demand. 

International public holidays such as Christmas, New Year’s and Easter are known for the immense amount of people traveling back and forth - either on national territory or flying to certain destinations - to spend the holidays with their families and friends. Moreover, travelers often find themselves in a position where they need to book hotel rooms, apartments or villas to be able to take part in these yearly celebrations along with their loved ones, sometimes seeking cheaper options. According to statistics from Airbnb (2015) and Kayak (2019, a travel booking platform, New York, Paris and Amsterdam have been found to be among the top 15 most popular destinations in the world between Christmas and New Years. 

The aim of this research is to investigate the effects of 3 public holidays (Christmas, New Years and Easter) on Airbnb room prices in the 3 aforementioned major cities (New York, Amsterdam, Paris) using ANOVA as the tool to analyze the effects of other covariates such as room type, superhost status and number of people that can be accommodated. The resulting coefficients and significance offer valuable insights into the drivers behind price fluctuations during holiday periods. 

Accordingly, this study could provide Airbnb hosts with pricing strategies during public holidays, which could potentially lead to increased earnings for them. On the other hand, the study could prove to be useful to tourists themselves, as they might be able to observe certain price increases or price differences between listings and the drivers behind the variations or price surges. Lastly, the analysis could become a basis for future academic research or integration in academic literature on the relationship between holidays and tourism.


**The research question is**: 
*How does the Airbnb room price change in New York, Paris, and Amsterdam between Christmas and New Year and over the Easter period in 2023, and how does the price fluctuations on holidays vary depending on room type, superhost status, number of people that can be accommodated?*
